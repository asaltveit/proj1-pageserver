A simple webserver that shows .html and .css files, and reports appropriate errors.

## What do I need? Where will it work? ##

Designed for Unix, mostly interoperable on Linux (Ubuntu) or MacOS. Target environment is Raspberry Pi. ** May also work on Windows, but no promises. A Linux virtual machine may work, but our experience has not been good; if you don't have a Raspberry Pi in hand yet, you may want to test on shared server ix-dev.

You will need Python version 3.4 or higher.

Designed to work in "user mode" (unprivileged), therefore using a port number above 1000 (rather than port 80 that a privileged web server would use)

Windows 10 note: The new Windows bash on ubuntu looks promising. If you are running Windows 10, please give this a try and let me know if the Ubuntu/bash environment is suitable for CIS 322 develpment.
